When I first started designing the colors of the site, I was troubled by the number of steps necessary to change the main colors of the site for each particular use. For example, every time I wanted to change a single color, I would have to change the hexadecimal value in each spot that it is in, as opposed to either changing the value variable with <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">SASS</a> or changing the spot of the variable.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$primary-color: #E3E7F2;\nbody{\n background-color: $primary-color;\n font: 14px Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>Another, slightly less problematic issue, was using nested CSS statements. The problem was always repeating the CSS Selector. When I just simply wanted to change how something is supposed to behave when hovering the whole CSS Selector needs to be repeated.</p>\n<p>These problems stem from repeating myself, which is against the rules of SASS, as the founders subscribe to the “Don’t Repeat Yourself” principle of programming, which I am a big proponent of myself, and am trying to implement it as much as I can.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"SASS, the Sassy CSS Preprocessor","date":"April 23, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/2-sass-the-sassy-css-preprocessor/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/1-welcome/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome.","id":1}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/3-opening-up-hashes-with-a-key/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Opening up Hashes with a Key","id":3}}}}}
