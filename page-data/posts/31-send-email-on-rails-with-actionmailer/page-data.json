There is some configuration required on the back-end to actually set up ActionMailer to actually send mail, but you can fake it for development purposes. There are certain things to be aware of when using ActionMailer. Specifically, you must define instance methods in the mailer class and you must call the instance methods on the mailer class when attempting to send the mail.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\"># app/mailers/user_mailer.rb\nclass UserMailer &lt; ActionMailer::Base\n  ...\n  def welcome(user)\n    @user = user\n    mail to: @user.email,\n      subject: &quot;Welcome to My Fabulous Web App!&quot;\n  end\n  ...\nend\n\n# app/controllers/users_controller.rb\nclass UsersController &lt; ApplicationController\n  ...\n  def create\n    user = sign_up(user_params)\n\n    if user.valid?\n      UserMailer.welcome(user).deliver\n      redirect_to user\n    else\n      render :new\n    end\n  end\n  ...\nend\n\n# app/views/user_mailer/welcome.html.erb\n&lt;h1&gt;Welcome &lt;%= @user.email %&gt; to my &lt;em&gt;Fabulous&lt;/em&gt; Web App.&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;%= link_to &quot;my site&quot;, root_url %&gt; as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre></div>\n<p>There are quite a few things going on here, not the least of which is the <code class=\"language-text\">UserMailer.welcome(user)</code> call. In this particular snippet of code, the user is created and sent a welcoming email. The view is also noteworthy, as it is being called by the mailer, which functions as a sort of controller and renders its view. Another thing about the view is when you include links, you must use url helper instead of path helper as the user’s computer has no base reference of the path to the site, and so, you must configure Rails to know what the domain name it is being hosted at.  </p>\n<p>Testing emails can be difficult as you have to check that the mail got sent, and that the view contains the appropriate text. Rails provides a method for testing if mail was sent, which is <code class=\"language-text\">ActionMailer::Base.deliveries</code>. This returns an array of the different mail that was sent, but testing the views won’t be so easy. Luckily there’s a gem for that. The <a href=\"https://github.com/bmabey/email-spec\">email_spec</a> gem makes testing the email contents really simple, so you can write your expectations clearly about the mailer and not worry about your tests failing but your code actually working.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Send Email on Rails with ActionMailer","date":"September 03, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/31-send-email-on-rails-with-actionmailer/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/30-nested-comments-with-active-record/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nested Comments with Active Record","id":30}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/32-postgrejson/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PostgreJSON","id":32}}}}}
