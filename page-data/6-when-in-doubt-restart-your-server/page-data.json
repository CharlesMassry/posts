We learned about the popular Domain Specific Language, Sinatra, yesterday at <a href=\"http://www.thisismetis.com\">Metis</a>. Often overshadowed by the behemoth that is Ruby on Rails, <a href=\"http://www.sinatrarb.com/\">Sinatra</a> is a RubyGem to start a web server quickly with syntax that looks like http requests.</p>\n<p>There are a few issues however, to running a Sinatra application. One of which that I mentioned earlier, is if you change the main Ruby file that you start to start the server, you must restart your server, which can lead to a lot of confusing error messages. Fortunately, you can pull out a bit of logic out of your server file and edit other files without issue, but always leave restarting your server in your back pocket.</p>\n<p>Another thing that was a little confusing was the URL parameter.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">require “sinatra”\n\nget &quot;/galleries/:name&quot; do\n  ...\n  @name = params[:name]\n  ...\nend</code></pre></div>\n<p>By putting the colon in front of name, you can turn that into whatever the user inputs, which I like to think of as the URL equivalent to <code class=\"language-text\">gets.chomp</code>. You then insert that as a key to the “params hash” and set an instance variable equal to its value, and now you can extract that into other files such as embedded Ruby, or erb.</p>\n<p>If the user were to type into the URL <code class=\"language-text\">localhost:4567/galleries/cats</code>, “cats” would be set to <code class=\"language-text\">@name</code>. This can enable you to do complex stuff, or you could just create a cat gallery.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"When in Doubt, Restart Your Server","date":"June 25, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/6-when-in-doubt-restart-your-server/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/5-the-sql-is-never-as-good-as-the-original/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The SQL is Never as Good as the Original","id":5}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/7-database-control-in-ruby/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Database Control in Ruby","id":7}}}}}
