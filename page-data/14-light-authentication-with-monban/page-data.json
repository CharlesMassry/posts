This gem provides some nifty, intuitive DSL.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">authenticate_session(session_params)`  \nsign_in(user)\nsigned_in?\nsign_out\nsign_up\ncurrent_user</code></pre></div>\n<p>These methods all do what you would think that they do, except maybe <code class=\"language-text\">authenticate_session</code>, which fetches the necessary keys from strong params during assignment to the user, <code class=\"language-text\">user = authenticate_session(session_params)</code>. You can then call <code class=\"language-text\">sign_in</code> on the result of this, to sign in the user. Monban also provides some neat callback methods, such as <code class=\"language-text\">require_login</code>, which is useful if you want to force user authentication before a particular action.</p>\n<p>Unlike Devise, it doesn’t provide you with specific Monban views or create large migration file for you. However, it still uses Warden and BCrypt for security, so while it is lightweight, it is by no means underpowered.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Light Authentication With Monban","date":"July 08, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/14-light-authentication-with-monban/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/13-cookie-monster-would-not-be-impressed-by-these-cookies/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cookie Monster Would Not Be Impressed By These Cookies","id":13}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/15-three-tables-are-better-than-two/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Three Tables Are Better Than Two","id":15}}}}}
